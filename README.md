#Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

This project is to clean up the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset is downloaded to the UCI HAR Dataset folder on the desktop from where the R code loads it into memory and uses various data transformations to provide a clean data set.

The R code being used can be found in the repository with the name run_analusis.R
